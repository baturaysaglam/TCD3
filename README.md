# Estimation Error Correction in Deep Reinforcement Learning for Deterministic Actor-Critic Methods
PyTorch implementation of the Triplet Critic Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient algorithm (TCD3). 
Note that this code heavily based on the [author's Pytorch implementation of the TD3 algorithm](https://github.com/sfujim/TD3). 
If you use our code or data please cite the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10736#).

The algorithm is tested on [MuJoCo](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#mujoco) and [Box2D](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#box2d) continuous control tasks. 
Following computing infrastructure is used in producing the results.
